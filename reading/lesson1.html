            Anna Keay reviews Charles Spencer’s book about the hunt
            for King Charles II during the English Civil War of the seventeenth
            century
        </p> 
        Charles Spencer’s latest book, To Catch a King, tells us the
        story of the hunt for King Charles II in the six weeks after his
        resounding defeat at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. And what
        a story it is. After his father was executed by the Parliamentarians in
        1649, the young Charles II sacrificed one of the very principles his
        father had died for and did a deal with Scots, thereby accepting
        Presbyterianism* as the national religion in return for being crowned
        King of Scots. His arrival in Edinburgh prompted the English
        Parliamentary army to invade Scotland in a pre-emptive strike. This was
        followed by a Scottish invasion of England. The two sides finally faced
        one another at Worcester in the west of England in 1651. After being
        comprehensively defeated on the meadows outside the city by the
        Parliamentarian army, the 21-year-old king found himself the subject of
        a national manhunt, with a huge sum offered for his capture, through a
        series of heart-poundingly close escapes, to evade the Parliamentarians
        before seeking refuge in France. For the next nine years, the penniless
        and defeated Charles wandered around Europe with only a small group of
        loyal supporters. Years later, after his restoration as king, the
        50-year-old Charles II requested a meeting with the writer and diarist
        Samuel Pepys. His intention when asking Pepys to commit his story to
        paper was to ensure that this most extraordinary episode was never
        forgotten. Over two three-hour sittings, the king related to him in
        great detail his personal recollections of the six weeks he had spent as
        a fugitive. As the king and secretary settled down (a scene that is
        surely a gift for a future scriptwriter), Charles commenced his story:
        ‘After the battle was so absolutely lost as to be beyond hope of
        recovery, I began to think of the best way of saving myself.’ One of the
        joys of Spencer’s book, a result not least of its use of Charles II’s
        own narrative as well as those of his supporters, is just how close the
        reader gets to the action. The day-by-day retelling of the fugitives’
        doings provides delicious details: the cutting of the king’s long hair
        with agricultural shears, the use of walnut leaves to dye his pale skin,
        and the day Charles spent lying on a branch of the great oak tree in
        Boscobel Wood as the Parliamentary soldiers scoured the forest floor
        below. Spencer draws out both the humour – such as the preposterous
        refusal of Charles’s friend Henry Wilmot to adopt disguise on the
        grounds that it was beneath his dignity – and the emotional tension when
        the secret of the king’s presence was cautiously revealed to his
        supporters. Charles’s adventures after losing the Battle of Worcester
        hide the uncomfortable truth that whilst almost everyone in England had
        been appalled by the execution of his father, they had not welcomed the
        arrival of his son with the Scots army, but had instead firmly bolted
        their doors. This was partly because he rode at the head of what looked
        like a59 foreign invasion force and partly because, after almost a
        decade of civil war, people were desperate to avoid it beginning again.
        This makes it all the more interesting that Charles II himself loved the
        story so much ever after. As well as retelling it to anyone who would
        listen, causing eye-rolling among courtiers, he set in train a series of
        initiatives to memorialise it. There was to be a new order of chivalry,
        the Knights of the Royal Oak. A series of enormous oil paintings
        depicting the episode were produced, including a two-metre-wide canvas
        of Boscobel Wood and a set of six similarly enormous paintings of the
        king on the run. In 1660, Charles II commissioned the artist John
        Michael Wright to paint a flying squadron of cherubs* carrying an oak
        tree to the heavens on the ceiling of his bedchamber. It is hard to
        imagine many other kings marking the lowest point in their life so
        enthusiastically, or indeed pulling off such an escape in the first
        place. Charles Spencer is the perfect person to pass the story on to a
        new generation. His pacey, readable prose steers deftly clear of modern
        idioms and elegantly brings to life the details of the great tale. He
        has even-handed sympathy for both the fugitive king and the fierce
        republican regime that hunted him, and he succeeds in his desire to
        explore far more of the background of the story than previous books on
        the subject have done. Indeed, the opening third of the book is about
        how Charles II found himself at Worcester in the first place, which for
        some will be reason alone to read To Catch a King. The tantalizing
        question left, in the end, is that of what it all meant. Would Charles
        II have been a different king had these six weeks never happened? The
        days and nights spent in hiding must have affected him in some way. Did
        the need to assume disguises, to survive on wit and charm alone, to use
        trickery and subterfuge to escape from tight corners help form him? This
        is the one area where the book doesn’t quite hit the mark. Instead its
        depiction of Charles II in his final years as an ineffective,
        pleasure-loving monarch doesn’t do justice to the man (neither is it
        accurate), or to the complexity of his character. But this one niggle
        aside, To Catch a King is an excellent read, and those who come to it
        knowing little of the famous tale will find they have a treat in store.
